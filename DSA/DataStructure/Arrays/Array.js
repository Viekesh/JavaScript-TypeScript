// What is data structure?
// A data structure is a way of storing data for access and modification. Every single data structure that
// you encounter is going to have a specific use case where it works best.

// What is algorithm?
// steps or process to arrange data.

// The main questions that you should ask while picking a data structure is:

// i. How quickly the data can  be access?
// ii. How quickly the data can be modified?


        
// Reasons to consider different types of data structures :
// i. May be an algorithm can go through the data sequentially
// ii. May be the algorithm is constantly searching through the data

// The main idea of data structures is very simple and straight forward. You are storing data in a way
// that they can be efficiently worked with. But you'll find that there's a lot of depth behind
// data structures and it's going to be a very core idea to algorithms, as you continue on
// with solving these different computer problems.

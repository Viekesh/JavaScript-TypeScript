                Nine noble families fight for control over the lands of Westeros,
                while an ancient enemy returns after being dormant for millennia.

                A popular misconception developed among viewers of the show that the
                show-runners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss had rushed the making of the
                final season so that they could move on to make a Star Wars project
                for Disney. While they did have several Star Wars movies planned at
                the time of the airing of Season 8, Benioff and Weiss have stated that
                their plans for the remainder of Game of Thrones (ending with Season
                8) were already mapped out in 2013, long before Disney approached them
                (who were still busy setting up Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force
                Awakens (2015) and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) at the time).
                Also, their Star Wars project was only due to come out in 2022, and
                since the show wrapped filming in 2018, the production tables of both
                series were not even remotely overlapping. The shorter number of
                episodes in Season 8 notwithstanding, the production of these final
                six episodes took twice as much time as a regular old ten-episode
                season, so the production wasn't even expedited. On top of that, a few
                months after the show aired its final episode, Benioff and Weiss chose
                to sign a hundred-million dollar deal with Netflix that forced them to
                withdraw from the Star Wars project, citing that they didn't have time
                to do justice to both deals - indicating that the Star Wars project
                wasn't on high priority for them in the first place.

<!-- href attribute is used to define the location where the user should be navigated to. -->
<!-- It takes in a url that points to a another page in the current website or to an external location. -->
<!-- The target attribute allows you to define the link to be opened in the current browser tab or a new one. -->

<!-- traditional "div". It is used to put content that cannot be placed in any other HTML element. Similar element -->
<!-- can be grouped inside section element. It can be used to put chapter, header, footer etc.  -->

<!-- HTML is used for building layouts and elements such as text, images, containers, lists and other elemetns. -->

<!-- CSS or cascading stylesheets are used for the visual appearance. -->
<!-- Such as the position of the element, their font, color and even animation. -->

<!-- JavaScript provides the logic and iteractivity that turns a document into a web application. -->
<!-- It is the language that defines the web and is used for making web content interactive and data driven. -->
<!-- It is used for the dynamically manipulating the content of the web page. -->
<!-- It is the most important language on the web today. -->
<!-- JavaScript can also be used for building applications that work at the backend and on a server. -->
<!-- Such application can be built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment that enable you to write -->
<!-- JavaScript applications that run on the server. -->
<!-- Inside your web browser there is a very critical piece of the puzzle, the JavaScript engine. -->
<!-- The version of the engine V8, which is used by Google chrome also. -->
<!-- Firefox uses a compiler known as spidermonkey and Microsoft uses chakra core. -->
<!-- It is the code that reads the JavaScript that you have written and compiles it to machine code -->
<!-- which then executes efficiently. These engine have become extremely powerful over the years. -->

<!-- If you think your web browser as a car then JavaScript is akin to a car's engine. -->
<!-- The host environment is differ, keeping the engine intact. -->
<!-- For instance, Node.js works on the server and incorporates chrome's V8 engine letting developer's -->
<!-- write brilliant server side code. -->



<!-- The "frontend" is the HTML, CSS and the JavaScript that comes from the server but work in your web browser. -->
<!-- It is giving you the user interface and other interactive feature. -->

<!-- The backend is responsible for providing data and other information to the applicatin sitting in your browser. -->
<!-- Also among several other things. -->

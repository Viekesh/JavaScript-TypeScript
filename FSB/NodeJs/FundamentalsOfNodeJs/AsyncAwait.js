// Adding the async keyword to a function definition makes it asynchronous. We use this method because we want

// Why must a function be asynchronous?

// To process something that takes time and to perform an asynchronous activity such as reading a file. The async
// keyword makes you aware that the result will be asynchronous and will take some time to complete.

// The await keywords waits for an asynchronous call to complete or end. That means it makes you aware that the
// function is asynchronous and at some point in the programme data is required for that asynchronous function.

// await keyword makes you wait for the required data to come in before proceding any further.

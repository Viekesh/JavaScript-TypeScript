// In this hands-on exercise, we will work on a component called UserCard which has to accept data using props. We will implement props in this function component so that it accepts data from a resource.

// Here weâ€™re rendering instances of the UserCard component here using a map function on a data Array that is being fetched from an external file. However, the three UserCard instances show the same data. We can use props to accept dynamic data from the resource.

// Open UserCard.js. Begin by accepting name, designation, isAdmin and photo as props by modifying the code as shown below.

import React from "react";
import "./PropsCss.css";
import users from "./PropsUsers";
import UserCard from "./PropsUserCard";


const PropsStarter = () => {
    return (
        <div className="app">
            {
                users.map(({id, name, designation, isAdmin, photo}) => (
                    <UserCard key={id} name={name} designation={designation} isAdmin={isAdmin} photo={photo} />
                ))
            }
        </div>
    );
};

export default PropsStarter;

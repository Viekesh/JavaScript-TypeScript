// The most fundamental element in a component is the visual elements (such as divs, text, images and dynamic components, right within JavaScript) that it has to render. 

// This is where JSX comes into the picture. It is a syntax that lets you describe what a component renders.

// But herein lies real power and flexibility. 

// JSX is like a templating syntax for React applications that makes it easy for developers to incorporate visual elements and dynamic data in a format and syntax that they’re somewhat familiar from the get go. 

// But the real power behind JSX is that it lets you use JavaScript all the way.

// React encourages the use of standard JavaScript instead of forcing you to use, library or framework-specific methods and directives. 

// This makes it easier for developers to embrace React because you don’t have to waste your energies on learning an opinionated syntax, just to be able to use the library. 

// Your existing knowledge of JavaScript is given due importance and is used extensively. 

// You may have noticed that JSX differs a bit from HTML and we’ve already discussed this fact. JSX is not HTML.






// How does JSX works?

// JSX is like a templating language which means it lets us describe visual elements in an HTML like syntax but internally it transforms the syntax into code that React actually uses.

// JSX is designed to produce React elements. 

// So, when you write JSX, it is compiled into standard JavaScript functions containing nested invocations of the createElement function which is what React uses to create renderable elements internally.  

// In fact, JSX is nothing more than syntactic sugar for the createElement function from the React library. 






// Why use JSX?

// A great developer experience is key and React certainly provides one, enabling all kinds of developers to easily embrace the library for their projects. 

// JSX is one way by which React makes it easy for developers to express visual elements and layouts and still retain the expressiveness of JavaScript.

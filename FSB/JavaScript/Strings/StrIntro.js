// As with everything in JavaScript, creating a string immediately brings forth a number of methods that exist on the prototype.

// Using these methods, it is interesting to come up with functions that can help you implement string processing capabilities in your web applications.

// Using String prototype methods you can do things like: 

// detecting the presence of a string in another string, targeting and modifying one character at a time, or a character at a given location, using Regular Expressions with text
// Regular expressions, for the uninitiated, are a syntax for defining patterns for matching characters and are found in most languages.  

// This allows you to build very powerful string-based functions that can help you create and validate known patterns such as email addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and so on. And just like arrays, we can slice and target portions of a string such as extracting data.

// In a nutshell, Strings are a lot of fun to play within JavaScript.

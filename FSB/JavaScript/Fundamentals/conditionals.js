// We can handle multiple conditions using if-else if-else

// We can have as many else-if blocks as we want

// What will be the output of following?

let season='monsoon'

if(season === 'summer'){
    console.log('Carry hat')
} else if(season === 'monsoon'){
    console.log('Carry umbrella')
} else if(season==='winter'){
    console.log('Carry jacket')
} else {
    console.log('Carry nothing')
}

// The condition in the first else-if block evaluates to true, hence carry umbrella is logged to the console.





// What is the purpose of using "switch" statement?

// Switch statement is used for performing different actions based on different conditions


// What is the purpose of using break keyboard in switch statement?

// break keyword is used to stop the execution and step out of the switch statement.


// When does the default case executes?

// switch statement excepts an expression. The value of the expression in the switch case is compared with the value of each case. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed. If there is no match, the default case code block is executed.


// You'll notice a variable named item set to 'Lettuce'. Let's try to identify if Lettuce is a fruit or a vegetable.

// Right after Line 4 and before the console.log statement at the end, add the following code to implement a switch-case conditional that can handle multiple common cases as well.

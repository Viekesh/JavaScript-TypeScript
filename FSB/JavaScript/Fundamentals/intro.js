// The worldwide web is more than 30 years old. The internet, however, is even older. In fact, it was 1960 when ARPANET first connected Stanford to UCLA. But the reality is that the web is actually getting younger by the day as both computational power and networks get better and better.

// Till the late 90s and even the early 2000s, the web was mostly made up of documents containing text and images because that was one of the original reasons for the world wide web.

// But ever since then, we’ve come a long way and into the age of full-blown web applications, which offer all the value and power of desktop applications, but from the comfort of a web browser.

// Your web browser is one of the grand podiums upon which great products and services are built and consumed. And it has only become better, faster and stronger over the years and will continue to be so in the future.

// All of this boils down to HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, the holy trinity that defines all web sites and web applications.



// HTML :

// HTML is used for building layouts and elements such as text, images, containers, lists, and other elements.

// CSS :

// CSS or cascading style sheets are used for defining the visual appearance such as the position of elements, their color, fonts, and even animation.

// JavaScript :

// JavaScript provides the logic and the interactivity that turns a document into a web application. It is the language that defines the web and is used for making web content interactive and data-driven and is used for dynamically manipulating the contents of web pages. It is the most important programming language on the web today.



// In general, we can divide web applications and sites into two core parts.

// Frontend :

// The frontend is the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that comes from the server but working in your web browser giving you the user interface and other interactive features.

// The backend is responsible for providing data and other resources to the application sitting in your browser, among saveral other things

// In a nutshell, the front-end and the back-end are two core components in this equation.

// Backend :

// JavaScript can also be used for building applications that work at the back end, and on a server.

// Such applications can be built using Node.js, a JavaScript run-time environment that enables you to write JavaScript applications that run on the server.



// WASM :

// There is a fourth official language that your browser supports. It's called Web Assembly or WASM in short. WASM apps are binary coded apps that are usually built and compiled down from C++, Rust, and several other languages and are great when you have to build a number-crunching computationally expensive application. But we’re talking about JavaScript, the language of the web.



// Now inside your web browser is a very critical piece of the puzzle - the JavaScript engine. It is the code that reads the JavaScript that you’ve written and compiles it to machine code which then executes efficiently. These engines have become extremely powerful over the years.

// The most important of these is V8 which is used in Google’s Chrome browser. On the other hand, Firefox uses a compiler known as Spidermonkey while Microsoft uses ChakraCore. In fact, if you think of your web browser as a car then the JavaScript engine is akin to a car’s engine. And the host environment may differ, keeping the engine intact. For instance, Node.js works on the server and incorporates Chrome’s V8 engine letting developers write brilliant server-side code.

// So, now that you know where JavaScript sits in the grand scheme of things, let’s go back in time to understand why and how JavaScript was created in the next topic.

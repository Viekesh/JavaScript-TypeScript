// What is Prototype?

// "In JavaScript, all objects inherit from a parent template known as a prototype"

// The simple logic behind the prototype is that it defines the methods and properties that should be available to all objects of that type.

// This makes it easy for you to simply create an object and get all the associated methods and properties automatically because they’re derived from this template known as a prototype.

// This is the same as saying that we design a prototype car first which is perfected and tested and its design is then used to mass-produce cars of that type. In this case, the features designed and implemented in the prototype are present in the manufactured cars.

// When the cars are exported to different countries, the base prototype is used as a foundation to implement changes as per country-specific rules and standards. But they’re all derived from a base prototype design.

For this we want to drop the element\n  // in the body of the HTML document to do this we'll access the body using \"document.body\" and I will use a\n  // method named \"append\" to literally append this newly created \"div\" to the existing content of the body.\n\n  // If you see HTML document using dev tools you'll see empty \"div\" appended to the body element and you'll\n  // see that our script tag shall sets above it this is because the append method saw the script tag as the\n  // existing content of the body and just appended the div after that in this case we want our socialCard\n  // to be above script tag. Therefore instead of using append we will use the \"prepend\" method. Now our div\n  // appears before the script tag in the body element.\n\n  // but so far we don't have the class attribute set. To do that we'll grab the handle to our socialCard div\n  // and we will use the set attribute method which takes an attribute name and its value. see below line we'll\n  // set the \"class\" \"social-card\".

Here we will create the \"icon\" and set\n  // it's class \"post-icon\"\n\n  const icon = document.createElement('div');\n  icon.setAttribute('class', 'post-icon');\n  const postTitle = document.createElement('div');\n  postTitle.setAttribute('class', 'post-title');\n  const postUser = document.createElement('div');\n  postUser.setAttribute('class', 'post-user');\n  const postContent = document.createElement('div');\n  postContent.setAttribute('class', 'post-content');\n  // So, far all of these have been instantiated to get them inside the socialCard div and to render them on to\n  // the page \n\n  // after creating element we use this append method to access the socialCard elements.\n  socialCard.append(icon, postTitle, postUser, postContent);\n  // We pass here all the nodes that need to be rendered and this create our social card even though there is\n  // not any content you can see icon because this is hard coded in css.\n\n  // So, now we can add some content...\n  // Remember we have our HTML tags in place on the page. Since we have created all the elements here. We can\n  // use their constants to access and manipulate them. In this case we will set a property on the postTitle\n  // div named innerText and it get's rendered on the page.\n  postTitle.innerText = title;\n\n  // As the name implies innerText will set the text content of the div based on the string that you provide.\n  // pretty cool and simple... right?\n\n  // Likewise let's set the content of the postUser and postContent div's like so...\n  postUser.innerText = 'Joe Mockery';\n  postContent.innerText = content;\n  document.body.prepend(socialCard);\n};\n\n// Now we can pass an object to the create post method with the title and content propeties sets like so...\n// And here you go.

It was a surreal experience to see sunlight at 2 in the morning! Couldn't sleep at all, but felt fresh!`\n});\n\n// Because we use \"document.body.prepend\" So the existing content of the div will remain and  the new post\n// just get's prepended on the top.\n// So the latest post go on the top, just like a social media site.\n// Let's add one more and there you go... Is not this fun. If you have an array of post here you can also use the\n// forEach method to look thorough the posts and dynamically generated social cards.\ncreatePost({\n  title: 'Working with JavaScript',\n  content: `It's been almost 10 years since I started working with JavaScript and it's awesome to see it grow to a mature and loved language.

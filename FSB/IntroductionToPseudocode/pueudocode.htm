    <!-- What is Pseudocode -->
    <!--
        Pseudocode is a simplified version of an algorithm that uses the English language to describe
        coding logic. It allows programmers to plan any algorithm structure by using simple commands.
        Pseudocode primarily uses plain text to describe various coding actions and the correct sequence
        of an algorithm.

        Here you will explore the type of programming languages, how do programming languages work and
        also the purpose and function of variables and some basic data types and structure that are used
        to organise daa within computer programmes. What we not explored yet are the various
        features of programming languages that you must used to put together the logic behind
        your programme. Think of them as building blocks of your programme. Computer programmes
        helps to solve problemmes, when you designing a solution of your problem. An algorithm
        is a series of ordered tasks that can help you achieve a goal.

    <!-- Why use Pseudocode? -->
    <!-- 
        Programming languages may involve complex logic and pseudocode provides an easy way for people
        to understand the basics of how software funcitons without having to learn computer programming.

        Programmers often use pseudocode as a reference before writing the actual code for a program.
        This allows them to determine the optimal way to write their algorithms and plan the layout of a
        large software project.

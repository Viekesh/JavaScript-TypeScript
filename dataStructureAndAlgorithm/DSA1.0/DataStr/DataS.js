// What are Data Structures?
    // Let’s  understand  what  a  data  structure  really  is,  and  the  different  ways  that  we  use  data 
    // structures in your day-to-day programming.A data structure is a way of storing data for access and modification.
    // Every single data structure that  you encounter  is  going  to  have  a  specific  use  case  where  it  works  
    // best.  There  are  lots  of different ways that you can store data based on what to be done with it.E.g., lists, 
    // arrays, which are just like lists of variousvalues






// How do we choose data structures?
    // In data structures, you work with data in the most efficient and effective manner.
    // You should be able to manipulate the input as quickly and efficiently as possible. If youcan't work with the data 
    // efficiently, you will never be able to solve the problem efficiently because the problem is based on the data, 
    // so we must be able to extract data and work with it
    // In such situations, it's important to pick out a data structure that is going to work best and the main
    // questions that you should ask while picking a data structure is:

        // i. How quickly the data can  be access?
        // ii. How quickly the data can be modified?


        
    // Reasons to consider different types of data structures :
        // i. May be an algorithm can go through the data sequentially
        // ii. May be the algorithm is constantly searching through the data
        // The main idea of data structures is very simple and straight forward. You are storing data in a way
        // that they can be efficiently worked with. But you'll find that there's a lot of depth behind
        // data structures, and it's going to be a very core idea to algorithms as you continue on 
        // with solving these different computer problems.






// Why Should You Learn Data Structure and Algorithm?
    // The  main  objective  is  to  understand  the  reasons  to  study  data  structures  and  algorithms. Data   
    // structures   and   algorithms   is   going   to   build   up   an   immense   understanding   in programming  and  
    // problem solving  for  you. It's  probably one of the most  important  topics that's discussed in computer science.






// Why Learn Data Structures?Let's discussabout data structures and need to learn the data structures.•The biggest 
// reason being that data is a core part of every application. To work efficiently with data, you need to use the 
// collect the correct structures. •In case of unstructured data, you have to access sequentially every single time 
// which will be  very  slow  and  hard  to  work  with.  You  need  to  be  able  to  work  with  your  data  as 
// efficiently as possible.•In the modern era of computing, data has become one of the biggest factors of processing in 
// the applications. •The main reason why you should care about data structures is that it helps you manage your  data  
// effectively.  If  the  result  is  going  to  be reliant  on  data,  you  will  get  faster programmes  that  are  
// more  efficient  and  effective  if  we  are  able  to  handle  our  data efficiently.•Big data is a huge topic in 
// computer science. In order to work with these big sets of data, you're going to need data structures that can handle 
// the data effectively.






// Why Learn Algorithms? •Every  single  programme  that  you  work  with  is lookingto  solve  a  problem. Youwrite 
// programmes, read it to do something, and that is solving a problem. Tosolve a problem, you need to come up with any 
// efficient solution.•Computer cannot solve every single problem it encounters. If you write a programme, it's not 
// guaranteed that your computer is going to able to solve that problem efficiently based on what you have written. 
// There are somecases where you can writeprogrammes that will never actually terminate if the input is large enough. 
// By understanding algorithms, you're able to write programmes that are going to be able to run efficiently and 
// effectively, not only will they be able to be solved, but in the fastest possible time. •The fastest possible time 
// is so important for computingi.e., every single thing needs to run  as  fast  as  possible.  Otherwise,  your  end  
// users  are  going  to  be  waiting  forever  for things to loadwhich will look bad on the performance of your 
// programme.•The algorithms are so importantbecause youneed applications to effectively run on the computer with 
// theminimal resources to work with in comparison to the problems that you are solving, You need to write programmes 
// that best use the availableresources.






// Toolkit of solutionsIn addition to this, algorithms havea toolkit of solutions for common problems.•Whenever  you  
// encounter  a  problem  that  you  need  to  solve,  most  people  will  start  to researchto how to solve that 
// problem in an effective way.•If you've studied algorithms before, you willhave a toolkit ready. You will understand 
// theproblemand canapply aparticularalgorithmto it. •Itwill solve the problem with the efficiency and willbe the 
// fastest possible efficiency.Itisthe best way to take care of any programming problem. •If  you  know  the  
// solutions  that  are  common  for  the  problems, you  willbe  able  to  write code in a more effective way, finish 
// programmes fasterand, run better.•It will be greatbecause you spend less time writing programmes and you are able to 
// sort of solve problems more efficiently.






// Algorithm in Problem SolvingAlgorithms  is  really  a  major  study  in  problem  solving.  In  general,  when  
// you're  working  on programmes, you're going to get problems thrown at you that are going to vary in complexity from 
// simple to extremely hard. Algorithms helps:•Towrite code more effectively.•Tofinish the program faster and the 
// program will run better.  •Tospend less time writing the program. •Tosort problems more efficiently and can 
// understand how to find a good solution to a problem.






// Importance of Algorithm and Data Structures•Algorithms help you to find the proper solution to problemsand also to 
// think more like a computer scientist.•Algorithms allow you to solve problems more efficiently and effectively.






// Every data structure will a have a use case for best work.

// Usually, the input and output will be different sets of data.

// Data is a core part of most computer applications.

// Proper data management techniques allow for faster programs.

// Programs are designed to solve problems.
